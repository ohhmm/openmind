# Findings and Solutions

## Overview
This document outlines the findings from the analysis of the GitHub Actions run for the "vcpkg-min-windows-for-devin" branch and the solutions implemented to resolve identified issues.

## Findings
During the analysis of the GitHub Actions run, the following issue was identified:
- **Missing Boost Header**: The build process failed due to a missing Boost header file, specifically `boost/multiprecision/cpp_int.hpp`. This indicates that the Boost library was not correctly installed or configured in the Windows environment.

## Solutions
To resolve the missing Boost header issue, the following solution was implemented:
- **Update CMakeLists.txt**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file was updated to include the `multiprecision` component in the `find_package` command for Boost. This ensures that all necessary Boost components are specified and available during the build process.

## Conclusion
The solution implemented should resolve the missing Boost header issue and allow the build process to complete successfully. Further monitoring of the GitHub Actions run is recommended to ensure that no additional issues arise.
