# Knowledge Base Update

This update integrates the consolidated knowledge base from PR #878 into the cross-session communication system.

## Updates Made

1. Exported the consolidated knowledge base and contradictions documents to the cross-session communication system
2. Updated the `session_knowledge` table with high-priority entries for:
   - `consolidated_knowledge` (priority 10)
   - `contradictions` (priority 9)
3. Added SQL scripts for maintaining the knowledge base

## Accessing the Knowledge Base

The knowledge base can be accessed through the cross-session communication system using SQL queries:

```sql
-- Get the consolidated knowledge base
SELECT knowledge_value FROM session_knowledge 
WHERE knowledge_type = 'consolidated_knowledge' 
ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Get the contradictions analysis
SELECT knowledge_value FROM session_knowledge 
WHERE knowledge_type = 'contradictions' 
ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## Repository Location

The cross-session communication system is located in the `context` branch of the `ohhmm/_` repository:
