:description: OpenMind component specifications

== Math Module (`omnn/math`)
* Variable type system with template-based operations
* Matrix algebra with optimized memory layout
* Equation solver supporting arithmetic, logarithmic, exponential operations
* Constants: pi (Ï€), e, i with arbitrary precision

== Runtime (`omnn/rt`)
* Lock-free neuron implementation with async message passing
* OpenCL/Vulkan compute pipeline for GPU acceleration
* Custom allocator with 16-byte alignment
* Thread pool with work stealing scheduler

== Language Processing (`lang`)
* Recursive descent parser for mathematical expressions
* Symbol table with scope management
* Pattern matching using AST transformations

== Storage Layer
