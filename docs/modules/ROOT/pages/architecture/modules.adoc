== Extrapolator Module

The Extrapolator module (`omnn/extrapolator`) provides:

* Matrix operations for data analysis
* Extrapolation algorithms
* Pattern recognition capabilities
* Data prediction models

== Logic Module

The Logic module (`omnn/logic`) implements:

* Logical operations framework
* Boolean algebra operations
* Inference engines
* Rule-based systems

== Compile-time Utilities

The CT module (`omnn/ct`) provides compile-time optimization tools:

* Template metaprogramming utilities
* Compile-time computation facilities
* Type trait helpers
* Static assertions and checks

== Goal Management System

=== Core Components

==== Mind Class
The central coordinator that manages:

* Goal prioritization
* State machine transitions
* Resource allocation
* Goal execution scheduling

==== Goal Generators

* `GeneralGoalGenerator`: Creates general-purpose goals
* `SingletonGoalGenerator`: One-time goal generation
* `IdleTimeGoalGenerator`: Utilizes system idle time

=== State Machine
* Goal state tracking
* Transition management
* Event handling
* Error recovery

=== Facilities
* Reusable operations
* Common patterns
* Utility functions
* Resource management
