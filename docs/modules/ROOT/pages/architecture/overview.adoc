:description: OpenMind system architecture and core components

== Core Systems

=== Knowledge System (`omnn/math`, `omnn/extrapolator`)
* Universal knowledge representation using mathematical structures
* Pattern recognition and extrapolation
* Matrix operations for data analysis
* Type-safe mathematical operations

=== Runtime System (`omnn/rt`)
* Asynchronous neural processing
* GPU-accelerated computations (OpenCL/Vulkan)
* Custom memory management
* Thread-safe operations

=== Goal Management (`Mind` class)
* State machine-based goal processing
* Resource allocation and scheduling
* Event-driven goal execution
* Priority-based task management
