* Self-modification with system integrity preservation
* Efficient memory management using Copy-on-Write
* Python integration through Boost.Python bindings
* Quantum computing capabilities
* Advanced bit manipulation operations
* Logic system for propositional reasoning
* Persistent storage with LevelDB integration
* Advanced mathematical operations
