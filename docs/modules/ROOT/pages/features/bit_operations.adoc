:description: Advanced bit manipulation operations in OpenMind

== Overview

OpenMind provides comprehensive bit manipulation capabilities through the `Valuable` class. These operations enable low-level bit manipulation, bitwise logical operations, and bit shifting functionality that are essential for certain mathematical and computational tasks.

== Implementation

The bit manipulation operations are implemented in the `Valuable` class in `omnn/math/Valuable.h`. The core bit operations include:

=== Bit Access and Manipulation

[source,cpp]
----
// From omnn/math/Valuable.h
class Valuable {
    // Bit access operations
    virtual Valuable bit(const Valuable& n = constants::zero) const;
    virtual Valuable bits(int n, int l) const;
    
    // Bitwise logical operations
    virtual Valuable Or(const Valuable& n, const Valuable&) const;
    virtual Valuable And(const Valuable& n, const Valuable&) const;
    
    // Logical operations
    Valuable LogicAnd(const Valuable& valuable) const;
    Valuable operator&&(const Valuable& valuable) const { return LogicAnd(valuable); }
    Valuable LogicOr(const Valuable& valuable) const;
    Valuable operator||(const Valuable& valuable) const { return LogicOr(valuable); }
    
    // Set operations (implemented using bit operations)
    Valuable Intersect(const Valuable& valuable) const;
    Valuable operator&(const Valuable& valuable) const { return Intersect(valuable); }
    Valuable& intersect(const Valuable& valuable, const Variable& va);
    Valuable& operator&=(const Valuable& valuable) { return intersect(valuable); }
    
    Valuable Union(const Valuable& valuable) const;
    Valuable& unionize(const Valuable& valuable);
    Valuable& operator|=(const Valuable& valuable) { return unionize(valuable); }
};

== Core Bit Operations

=== Bit Access

* `bit(n)`: Extracts the nth bit from the value
* `bits(n, l)`: Extracts l bits starting from position n

=== Bitwise Logical Operations

* `Or(a, b)`: Performs bitwise OR between the value and operands a and b
* `And(a, b)`: Performs bitwise AND between the value and operands a and b
* `Xor(a, b)`: Performs bitwise XOR between the value and operands a and b
* `Not()`: Performs bitwise NOT on the value

=== Bit Shifting

* `shl(n)`: Shifts the value left by n bits (in-place)
* `shr(n)`: Shifts the value right by n bits (in-place)
* `Shl(n)`: Returns a new value shifted left by n bits
* `Shr(n)`: Returns a new value shifted right by n bits
* `Cyclic(n)`: Performs a cyclic shift (rotation) by n bits

== Set Operations Using Bit Manipulation

OpenMind implements set operations using bit manipulation for efficiency:

* `Intersect(v)`: Set intersection (implemented as bitwise AND)
* `Union(v)`: Set union (implemented as bitwise OR)
* `Remove(v)`: Set difference
* `RootSetDifference(v)`: Root set difference
* `RootsSymetricDifference(v)`: Symmetric difference of root sets

== Usage Examples

=== Basic Bit Manipulation

[source,cpp]
----
#include <omnn/math/Valuable.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace omnn::math;

int main() {
    // Create a value
    Valuable v = 42_v;  // Binary: 101010
    
    // Extract bits
    Valuable bit2 = v.bit(2);  // Get the 3rd bit (0-indexed): 1
    Valuable bits23 = v.bits(2, 2);  // Get 2 bits starting from position 2: 10
    
    // Bitwise operations
    Valuable result_or = v.Or(15_v, 0_v);  // 42 OR 15: 47 (101111)
    Valuable result_and = v.And(15_v, 0_v);  // 42 AND 15: 10 (1010)
    
    // Bit shifting
    Valuable shifted_left = v.Shl(2);  // 42 << 2: 168 (10101000)
    Valuable shifted_right = v.Shr(2);  // 42 >> 2: 10 (1010)
    
    std::cout << "Original value: " << v << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Bit 2: " << bit2 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Bits 2-3: " << bits23 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "OR with 15: " << result_or << std::endl;
    std::cout << "AND with 15: " << result_and << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Left shift by 2: " << shifted_left << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Right shift by 2: " << shifted_right << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}

=== Set Operations

[source,cpp]
----
#include <omnn/math/Valuable.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace omnn::math;

int main() {
    // Create two values representing sets
    Valuable set1 = 42_v;  // Binary: 101010 (represents set {1, 3, 5})
    Valuable set2 = 15_v;  // Binary: 1111 (represents set {0, 1, 2, 3})
    
    // Set operations
    Valuable intersection = set1 & set2;  // Intersection: 10 (represents set {1, 3})
    Valuable union_set = set1 | set2;     // Union: 47 (represents set {0, 1, 2, 3, 5})
    Valuable difference = set1.Remove(set2);  // Difference: 32 (represents set {5})
    
    std::cout << "Set 1: " << set1 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Set 2: " << set2 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Intersection: " << intersection << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Union: " << union_set << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Difference (Set1 - Set2): " << difference << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}

== Performance Characteristics

The bit operations in OpenMind are designed for efficiency:

* *Time Complexity*:
  * Bit access operations (`bit`, `bits`): O(1)
  * Bitwise logical operations (`Or`, `And`, `Xor`, `Not`): O(n) where n is the number of bits
  * Bit shifting operations (`shl`, `shr`, `Shl`, `Shr`): O(n) where n is the number of bits
  * Set operations: O(n) where n is the number of bits

* *Space Complexity*:
  * Most operations: O(1) additional space
  * Operations returning new values: O(n) where n is the number of bits

* *Optimization*:
  * Operations are optimized for integers and use hardware-level bit manipulation when possible
  * Large integers use specialized algorithms for efficient bit manipulation

== Integration with Mathematical System

The bit operations integrate with OpenMind's mathematical expression system:

1. *Symbolic Bit Manipulation*: Perform bit operations on symbolic expressions
2. *Optimization*: Automatically optimize bit operations during expression evaluation
3. *Type Conversion*: Seamlessly convert between different numerical representations
