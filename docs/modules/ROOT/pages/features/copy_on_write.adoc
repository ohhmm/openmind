:description: Implementation and usage of the Copy-on-Write memory model in OpenMind

== Overview

OpenMind implements a Copy-on-Write (COW) memory model in the `Valuable` class to optimize memory usage and performance. This allows multiple objects to share the same underlying data until one of them needs to modify it, at which point a unique copy is created for the modifying object.

== Implementation

The COW implementation is centered around the `clone_on_write()` method in the `Valuable` class:

[source,cpp]
----
// From omnn/math/Valuable.h
protected:
    using encapsulated_instance = ptrs::shared_ptr<Valuable>;
    encapsulated_instance exp = nullptr;
    
    /// Ensures a unique copy of the object before modification (Copy-on-Write)
    void clone_on_write();
----

When a modifying operation (like `operator+=`) is called on a `Valuable` object, the `clone_on_write()` method is invoked to ensure the object has exclusive ownership of its data before making any changes.

== Benefits

* **Memory Efficiency**: Multiple objects can share the same memory until modification
* **Performance**: Reduces unnecessary copying of large objects
* **Thread Safety**: When properly used, helps manage access to shared data
* **Simplicity**: Implementation details are hidden from the user

== Usage Example

[source,cpp]
----
#include <omnn/math/Valuable.h>

using namespace omnn::math;

int main() {
    // Create a Valuable object
    Valuable v1 = 42_v;
    
    // Create a second reference to the same object
    Valuable v2 = v1;
    
    // At this point, v1 and v2 share the same data
    // Modifying v2 will trigger a copy
    v2 += 10_v;
    
    // Now v1 is still 42, but v2 is 52
    std::cout << "v1: " << v1 << std::endl;  // Output: v1: 42
    std::cout << "v2: " << v2 << std::endl;  // Output: v2: 52
    
    return 0;
}
----

== Testing

The COW functionality is verified through unit tests in `omnn/math/test/Valuable_COW_test.cpp`, which tests various scenarios to ensure proper copying behavior.
