# Comprehensive Report on Vcpkg and Boost Integration

## Overview
This report details the integration of Vcpkg and Boost into the `ohhmm/openmind` project, including changes made to the `CMakeLists.txt` file, GitHub Actions workflow, and the rationale behind each modification.

## Changes Made

### CMakeLists.txt
- **CMake Version**: Reverted to 3.14 to maintain consistency with the original project setup.
- **Vcpkg Integration**: Enabled Vcpkg by setting the toolchain file.
- **Boost Integration**: Added `find_package` for Boost components, including filesystem, system, and unit_test_framework.

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Matrix Build**: Configured for Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
- **Boost Test**: Included Boost Test in the workflow to verify functionality across platforms.

## Justifications
- **CMake Version**: The change to 3.15 was unnecessary; reverting to 3.14 ensures compatibility with existing configurations.
- **Vcpkg and Boost**: Aligning with the minimal example ensures consistent dependency management and build processes.

## Results
- The integration was successful, with the GitHub Actions workflow completing without errors across all platforms.

## Conclusion
The project now has a robust setup for managing dependencies and building across multiple platforms, leveraging Vcpkg and Boost effectively.
