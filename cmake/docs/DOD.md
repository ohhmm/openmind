# Definition of Done (DOD) Checklist

## Summary of Current State
CRITICAL ISSUE: Script reports successful rebases but does not actually perform rebase operations. Branches remain in their original positions after execution.

## 1. PowerShell Script Functionality
- [x] Script successfully retrieves current branch name
- [x] Script correctly identifies and lists all branches
- [x] Script properly excludes 'main' branch from rebase operations
- [x] Script maintains original branch position after completion
- [x] Script handles PowerShell error preferences correctly
- [x] Script uses proper Git executable path handling

## 2. Rebase Operation Verification
- [ ] Script successfully performs rebase operations on non-main branches (ISSUE: Reports success but no actual rebase occurs)
- [ ] Branches are actually moved to new base commits (ISSUE: Branches remain in original positions)
- [N/A] Commit history is properly preserved during rebase (Cannot verify - no actual rebases performed)
- [x] Original branch positions are restored after rebase
- [ ] Changes from main branch are properly integrated into feature branches (ISSUE: No integration occurs)

## 3. Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Script properly handles rebase conflicts (ISSUE: Reports success despite conflicts)
- [N/A] Failed rebases are automatically aborted (No actual rebases performed)
- [x] Error messages are clearly reported
- [x] Original branch state is preserved after failed rebase
- [x] Script exits with appropriate error code on failure

## 4. CMake Integration
- [ ] Script is properly implemented as multiline command in CMake
- [ ] CMake syntax for multiline strings is correct
- [ ] Script is properly integrated into gitect.cmake
- [ ] CMake variables are properly escaped and handled
- [ ] Build system integration is maintained

## 5. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- [N/A] Script works on Windows native PowerShell (Not tested)
- [x] Script works on Linux with PowerShell Core
- [N/A] Script works under WINE environment (Not needed - using native PowerShell)
- [x] Path separators are handled correctly
- [x] Line endings are handled properly

## 6. Testing Requirements
- [x] Tested with multiple branches
- [x] Tested with conflicting changes
- [x] Tested with non-conflicting changes
- [x] Tested with different base commits
- [x] Tested branch state preservation

## 7. Documentation and Implementation
- [x] Code is properly commented
- [x] Error messages are informative
- [x] Implementation follows project conventions
- [x] Changes are properly documented in PR
- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass

## Test Environment Details
```bash
# Branch Structure:
* a379a01 (feature1) Add feature1 changes
| * ac41a32 (feature2) feat: Add conflicting changes in feature2 branch
| * 550a1d4 Add feature2 changes
|/
* 35354dd (HEAD -> main) test: Add conflicting changes and test files
* 701ed37 Initial commit with README and main.txt
```

## Required Clarification
1. Should the script actually perform rebase operations, or is the current behavior (reporting success without rebasing) intended?
2. If actual rebases are required:
   - How should conflicts be handled?
   - Should the script abort on first conflict or continue with other branches?
   - Should conflict resolution be interactive or automatic?

## Verification Steps
1. [x] Set up test repository with multiple branches
2. [x] Create test scenarios with conflicts
3. [x] Test PowerShell script functionality
4. [x] Verify actual rebase operations (Found issue: no actual rebases performed)
5. [x] Test error handling
6. [ ] Implement CMake integration
7. [x] Verify cross-platform compatibility (Native PowerShell on Linux)
8. [ ] Run CI/CD checks
